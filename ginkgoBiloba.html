    <p>Fun Fact: The Ginkgo Biloba is also known as the Maiden Hair Tree.</p>
    <section class='infoLinks'>

        <h2 class='info'>General</h2>
        <p>
          Commonly known as ginkgo or gingko but also known as the maidenhair tree.
          This tree species is native to China. It is the only living species in the
          order Ginkgoales, which first appeared over 290 million years ago.  Because
          fossilized remains dating back to the Permian period morphologically appear
          resemble our modern-day Gingko tree, it is considered a “living fossil,” a
          term used to refer to species that have changed little since their discovery
          in the fossil record. The Ginkgo tree was cultivated for centuries in China,
          especially around Buddhist temples and monasteries. The tree was first introduced
          to the United States in 1784. Today it is a popular tree used in city landscaping
          because of its tolerance to pollution. The leaves turn a beautiful golden yellow
          in the fall. The Ginkgo tree moderate sized and its leaves have a unique fan-like
          shape with dichotomously branching leaves, that may be notched. The tree has separate
          male and female trees and is dioecious. Female trees can sometimes be discriminated
          against in landscaping selection due to the female’s production of a fleshy
          strawberry-shaped coat, which surrounds their seeds. This coat when rotting or
          stepped upon has a distinctive smell described by some as rancid butter or dog feces.
          Despite this the seed, or gingko nut is considered a delicacy in China and served at
          weddings because it is thought to bring food luck. Today, extracts of the leaves
          are used as commercially available herbal supplements to improve short term memory and enhance concentration.
