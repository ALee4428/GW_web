      <h3>ABOUT: Here you will find information concerning the Greeneville
        downtown area as well as directional guides for the Greeneville WALKS
        Arboretum. Greeneville WALKS will consist of several brief walking
        tours that originate from the Walters State Niswonger Campus. The walks
        highlight local historical interests as well as provide tree, shrub and
        plant identification for nature enthusiasts. This interactive website
        will provide a guided virtual walking tour using area tree species as an
        educational focal point for the area's rich history. Each walking trail
        will showcase the town's trees as the silent sentinels of history, art,
        literature, food and music. In the future we hope to provide additional
        information concerning Greeneville's past, present, and future such as
        history, nature, current events, local government and business activities
        as well as information about area national parks and civil war trails.
        This is a place where our community of learners can come together.
