        <p>Anyone who knows me knows how much I love the study of plants; Botany.
          I do not always get to teach this fascinating subject or share my
          enjoyment of it as much as I would like, but I keep trying! Before
          completing my doctorate, I worked as a high school science teacher at
          Sevier County High School and helped to facilitate an onsite, one-mile
          nature trail with two rustic, outdoor classrooms. The onsite nature
          trail I facilitated certified as an arboretum. My peers and I were
          especially happy about this success because this effort was the first
          high school-based arboretum project in the state! I was fortunate enough
          to observe, firsthand, how the project benefited my student’s learning
          experience. Overtime, the trail became more popular, and the school’s
          learning environment was greatly enhanced by a sense of shared community.
          After the positive experience I gained as a high school teacher, I began
          work at the postsecondary level in education. I welcomed the opportunity
          to build on a botanical course which examined the impact plants have on
          our daily lives. While many people recognize the value of vegetation in
          terms of oxygen creation, lumber, clothing, and food, unfortunately the
          impact plants and trees have on a region’s culinary choices, medicine,
          art, music, literature, recreation, and history often go unnoticed. This
          botanical course allowed me to further explore the overlooked impact of
          flora with my students and overtime, students, both locally and globally,
          began to volunteer their knowledge and personal experience. This shared
          learning enriched the course further, and not only encouraged me in
          further studies, but encourages me still. The concept of this project is
          the culmination of life interest and experience.
